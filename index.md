&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Rocket VPN accelerator maintains the privacy and online freedom of users, and users have the right to understand how we manage and protect your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.<br />
<br />
Our top priority is customer data security and user privacy. We will adjust our privacy policy based on policies and product conditions. Users should pay attention to this policy in time.

VPN private network<br />
<br />
Because our service core is a VPN private network, we will route all your Internet communications through our network, and our software client will establish and maintain an encrypted tunnel between your device and our network. Your data is safe.<br />
<br />
VPN networks are log-free networks. This means that we do not collect any information transmitted over the network. More specifically, when you visit a VPN private network, we do not collect any information about the websites or IP addresses you visit. We do not collect any data stored on or from your device, including applications on your device and any data that can be transmitted through our network.<br />
